# Iris_Flower_Classification

This repository implements a simple Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression. The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features.

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each instance is labeled with one of three iris species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. We will use this dataset to train our Logistic Regression model.
